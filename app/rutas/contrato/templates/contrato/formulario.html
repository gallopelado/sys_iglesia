                                            <h2>Minas Tirith</h2>
                                            <p><br></p>
                                            <p>Pippin looked out from the shelter of Gandalf"s cloak. He wondered if he
                                                was awake or still sleeping, still in the swift-moving dream in which he
                                                had been wrapped so long since the great ride began. The dark world was
                                                rushing by and the wind sang loudly in his ears. He could see nothing
                                                but the wheeling stars, and away to his right vast shadows against the
                                                sky where the mountains of the South marched past. Sleepily he tried to
                                                reckon the times and stages of their journey, but his memory was drowsy
                                                and uncertain.</p>
                                            <p><br></p>
                                            <p>There had been the first ride at terrible speed without a halt, and then
                                                in the dawn he had seen a pale gleam of gold, and they had come to the
                                                silent town and the great empty house on the hill. And hardly had they
                                                reached its shelter when the winged shadow had passed over once again,
                                                and men wilted with fear. But Gandalf had spoken soft words to him, and
                                                he had slept in a corner, tired but uneasy, dimly aware of comings and
                                                goings and of men talking and Gandalf giving orders. And then again
                                                riding, riding in the night. This was the second, no, the third night
                                                since he had looked in the Stone. And with that hideous memory he woke
                                                fully, and shivered, and the noise of the wind became filled with
                                                menacing voices.</p>
                                            <p><br></p>
                                            <p>A light kindled in the sky, a blaze of yellow fire behind dark barriers
                                                Pippin cowered back, afraid for a moment, wondering into what dreadful
                                                country Gandalf was bearing him. He rubbed his eyes, and then he saw
                                                that it was the moon rising above the eastern shadows, now almost at the
                                                full. So the night was not yet old and for hours the dark journey would
                                                go on. He stirred and spoke.</p>
                                            <p><br></p>
                                            <p>"Where are we, Gandalf?" he asked.</p>
                                            <p><br></p>
                                            <p>"In the realm of Gondor," the wizard answered. "The land of Anórien is
                                                still passing by."</p>
                                            <p><br></p>
                                            <p>There was a silence again for a while. Then, "What is that?" cried Pippin
                                                suddenly, clutching at Gandalf"s cloak. "Look! Fire, red fire! Are there
                                                dragons in this land? Look, there is another!"</p>
                                            <p><br></p>
                                            <p>For answer Gandalf cried aloud to his horse. "On, Shadowfax! We must
                                                hasten. Time is short. See! The beacons of Gondor are alight, calling
                                                for aid. War is kindled. See, there is the fire on Amon Dîn, and flame
                                                on Eilenach; and there they go speeding west: Nardol, Erelas,
                                                Min-Rimmon, Calenhad, and the Halifirien on the borders of Rohan."</p>
                                            <p><br></p>
                                            <p>But Shadowfax paused in his stride, slowing to a walk, and then he lifted
                                                up his head and neighed. And out of the darkness the answering neigh of
                                                other horses came; and presently the thudding of hoofs was heard, and
                                                three riders swept up and passed like flying ghosts in the moon and
                                                vanished into the West. Then Shadowfax gathered himself together and
                                                sprang away, and the night flowed over him like a roaring wind.
                                            </p>
                                            <p><br></p>
                                            <p>Pippin became drowsy again and paid little attention to Gandalf telling
                                                him of the customs of Gondor, and how the Lord of the City had beacons
                                                built on the tops of outlying hills along both borders of the great
                                                range, and maintained posts at these points where fresh horses were
                                                always in readiness to bear his errand-riders to Rohan in the North, or
                                                to Belfalas in the South. "It is long since the beacons of the North
                                                were lit," he said; "and in the ancient days of Gondor they were not
                                                needed, for they had the Seven Stones." Pippin stirred uneasily.</p>
                                            <p><br></p>
                                            <p>"Sleep again, and do not be afraid!" said Gandalf. "For you are not going
                                                like Frodo to Mordor, but to Minas Tirith, and there you will be as safe
                                                as you can be anywhere in these days. If Gondor falls, or the Ring is
                                                taken, then the Shire will be no refuge."</p>
                                            <p><br></p>
                                            <p>"You do not comfort me," said Pippin, but nonetheless sleep crept over
                                                him. The last thing that he remembered before he fell into deep dream
                                                was a glimpse of high white peaks, glimmering like floating isles above
                                                the clouds as they caught the light of the westering moon. He wondered
                                                where Frodo was, and if he was already in Mordor, or if he was dead; and
                                                he did not know that Frodo from far away looked on that same moon as it
                                                set beyond Gondor ere the coming of the day.</p>
